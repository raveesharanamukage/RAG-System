            "['\\n\\nWhat I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could r', \"It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\\n\\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and \"]\n"
